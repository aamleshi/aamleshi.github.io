Before I begin my argument, I need to admit that I love YouTube. There can be no debate that YouTube makes a treasure trove of entertainment and information accessible ubiquitously. More personally, I grew up watching YouTube — and watched it grow up with me. The YouTube that exists now is fundamentally not the same product as the YouTube that I first got hooked on. I believe very strongly that in order for our free market to work, we need maximum information on the products that we consume.

This article presents a line of ontological inquiry that shows that YouTube is fundamentally indistinguishable from an adversary attempting to ruin your life. I consider this category distinction through 1.) The incentive mismatch between a user and YouTube, and 2.) the topological characteristics of a “YouTube session” defining a particular mode of agency accessible to YouTube in influencing its users.

YouTube as a core business is completely driven by income from displaying advertisements. True, YouTube Premium allows subscribers to spend their money instead of their time for the privilege of using YouTube. However, YouTube Premium only makes up a fraction of YouTube’s revenue.[^1][^2] This means that we can comfortably stick to an examination of the incentives of an advertisement based model.

Considering that YouTube makes their money from advertisement, maximizing their revenue means they are incentivized to show as many ads as possible. Holding the optimal content/advertisement ratio[^3] that a viewer will tolerate as a constant, YouTube is incentivized to maximize the amount of time user’s spend on the platform. This means either 1.) Increasing the total number of unique viewers or 2.) Increasing the amount of time individual users spend on the platform.

YouTube’s original sin can be found its stake in increasing the amount of time individual users spend on the platform. In a vacuum, this incentive can be cast as neutral or even positive to user experience. This metric is one of the guiding north stars of the YouTube design team, and Alphabet in general has developed organizational excellence at designing towards it. The best way to increase Time On Device is through better content and more relevant recommendations, so says the conventional discourse.

This was an extremely convoluted way of saying what everyone knows. YouTube wants you to spend as long as possible watching. This is not an incentive system that is new to YouTube - cable TV has had it for decades. However, this incentive became malignant when exposed to the unique agency provided by YouTube’s topology.


However, incentives alone are not enough to define a being as an adversary. As a thought experiment, consider 2 people — Alice, and Bob — who are playing a game of chess for a 10$ prize. Alice and Bob are obviously adversaries (in the domain of the game of chess). However, if Chris bet 10 dollars that Bob would lose the game, are Chris and Bob adversaries? I use the definition of an adversary as “one's opponent in a contest, conflict, or dispute”. We can thus colloquially define an adversarial relationship as being a relationship where two entities are playing a game with opposing aims. Chris has no ability to affect the game’s outcomes, and is thus not Bob’s adversary, as Chris has no possible agency in the dynamic. Chris is not a player of the game. Thus, to show YouTube is an adversary, we must examine if YouTube has a channel of influential agency on its users.

### But first, an ode to The Weird Side of YouTube


The Weird Side of YouTube (WSoY) was a magical place whose door was forever closed sometime in the late 2010’s [^4]. For those who missed it, the closest existing relic is the [important videos playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6EoRBvdVPQ&list=PLFsQleAWXsj_4yDeebiIADdH5FMayBiJo) - a mind bending symphony of videos connected only by the thread of their property of “being weird”. You almost never started a YouTube session on the Weird Part, you ended up there by starting at a (often) completely reasonable video, then always picking the weirdest video recommendation. Eventually, you would enter some bizarro corner of YouTube. For those who are still lost, substitute “weird” for “1997 Ford Taurus” or “Emeril Lagasse Fan Compilation” parts of YouTube.

What I loved most about the WSoY was that it was a shared experience. I often spent my school lunch hours engaged in discourse with my fellow WSoY scholars, swapping links like explorers sharing maps. This was the result of the early recommendation systems, which gave the same recommendations to mostly everyone from a particular video. The WSoY was the result of old YouTube being a reference network existing somewhere in cyberspace. 

The arrangement of videos on old YouTube was the cyberspace analog of a physical library. While a reading syllabus or recommendation (a playlist or an article with links) does lead to a more directed viewing experience, I have always enjoyed the fact that the structure of a library lets me just wander around sections that I am likely to be interested (linger in the technology section, avoid the calendar section). While there is an incentive to recommend videos which lead users to spending more time on the platform - the entire user base is addressed at once. This is like how a library often will display its most popular books prominently. 

Hyper-personalization killed the Weird Side of YouTube. While recommendations today still bear some aspect of locality, they are mostly personal to you. YouTube’s recommendations are now individual experiences, and shared YouTube experiences must be found elsewhere.

While there might be some feature of media itself that causes an individual to be more or less likely to keep watching (some videos are better than others 5head), YouTube does not have much direct ability to define the precise character of the content that it hosts. While it can guide content through incentive systems (Demonetization), or direct promotion (the recommendation algorithm decides what videos get views, giving a lever to nudge content creators) — this is not an immediate agency. Additionally, these outlets of YouTube’s agency represent an agency towards the entire YouTube catalog -as it is ubiquitously accessible to every user- at once. Cable TV got to choose their programming. Thus, YouTube’s primary agency towards an individual user exists in its ability to present video recommendations. 

Before hyper-personalization, the structure of the YouTube recommendation network could be visualized as one large graph with videos as nodes and each edge being given a set of weights. Each weight in this set would correspond to a level of similarity over some characteristic of the video. For example two dog videos can be similar over the properties of say 1.) Breed of dog 2.)Cuteness of video 3.) If the dogs are rewarded with food.

However, what does it mean for one video to relate to another video in the general sense? The meaning of a relation cannot be found in either video being related. The meaning of the relation can only be understood with the additional context of the person the video is being recommended to. This is because a video is similar to another video only in terms of how an viewer would judge them to both embody a certain property. The similarity between two videos exists in YouTube’s estimation of how they both embody some property with respect to a viewer.

Thankfully, we can use the incentive system of YouTube to simplify the relation further. From an organization perspective, YouTube is a product designed to maximize Time On Device. This is the metric that drives how YouTube is made, the one that determines compensation and promotion. From the perspective of Time On Device, the metric becomes **“Given video A, videos from set B are ranked by the probability that a user will watch video b if present in the video A recommendations”.** This similarity is contextualized with respect to historical information on the viewing pattern of all other viewers. 

Without hyper-personalization, the best possible relation between videos is the relation of content (colloquial similarity). If you know nothing about a user other than the fact that they are watching a dog video, your best bet to get them to watch more videos is to offer them more dog videos, and maybe diversify your bet with a cat clip or two.

Now YouTube can leverage everything that Alphabet (Google’s parent) knows about you to provide the context for their video recommendation algorithms. 
Ok, now given this particular movement from the individual as a single video, to the individual as the entire viewing history of a user, what is the fundamental relation in recommendation? Rather than being a video-video relation, hyper-personalization insists that the relation is now a history-video similarity, with the most recent video usually given the greatest weight. This means the task of recommendation is now: **“Given video A and context C, videos from set B are ranked by the probability that a user with context C will watch video b if present in the video A recommendations”**

To restate - a video should be recommended IF the historical pattern of consumption by one user would indicate that they would be likely to watch said video. But remember that this recommendation always stands outside the set of videos that the receiving user has seen (except in the now rare case of an already seen video being recommended again). Recommendation is thus a form of attempted prophecy, where YouTube is monetarily rewarded for picking videos that a user is more likely to watch. 

Now recall YouTube’s fundamental incentive, to maximize the per-person amount of time spent on the platform. The relation of recommendation is not simply matching a user’s past with a most likely next video. YouTube is incentivized to match a user’s past with whichever potential future contains the most time spent watching YouTube! 

This leaves us with my final generalization what video similarity should ultimately mean to YouTube with respect to their incentives: **“Given video A and context C, videos from set B are ranked by how much YouTube Viewing they predict in a future with context C if b is present in the Video A recommendations”**

An illustrative thought experiment should be to consider which episode of a long series YouTube should ideally recommend. This video should usually be the first one (barring an parks and rec style terrible first season), if you want to nudge users into becoming users who will end up watching the whole series. Alternatively, if you want to acclimate a user to watch Eric Andre, you should start off recommending his most accessible skits, then ramping up the grossness as they have developed the habit of watching them.


Human behavior is influenced by a combination of intention and habit.[^5] The impact of intention is easily understood - think about how either strongly or weakly holding the priority “I want to get an A in this class so I should study will affect how much time you spend studying. The second factor feels more nebulous, but is often times more predictive of experienced behaviors. Our brains have been shown to heuristically make decisions based on how strongly we react to a particular stimulus with a form of action. This means that we build habits by doing things repeatedly, and you are more likely to do something you have a habit for than something you don’t.

Essentially that means that once you get someone into the habit of doing a particular action in reaction to a particular stimuli (like a time of day, or when eating dinner, or a twinge of boredom), then you radically increase the chance that they will keep doing this action for the foreseeable future. In fact, one often finds it difficult to break these habits at a conscious level, as anyone who has attempted a diet or a reddit fast would know.

Bringing this argument full circle, the presence of habits in a person’s viewing history is highly correlated with higher amounts of time spent carrying out said habit in the person’s future. If we consider the hypothesis that this relation is causal (it almost certainly is), then if YouTube wants users who spend the maximum possible amount of time watching, they should choose to relate videos not on the basis of maximizing the prediction of next video watch time, but of total watch time. This means that YouTube is ultimately incentivized towards producing a sequence of videos that lead to habit formation.

Thus YouTube’s adversarial game reveals itself. Given the presence of other incentives in your life, in your best world you will want to spend as little as possible time on YouTube to gain the highest yield value. At the same time, YouTube is looking to sneak in habits into your life that increase you Time On Device. This is required from their incentives, and feasible because of hyper-personalized recommendations.

You want to use YouTube in such a way that you do not develop habits that impede your other goals (you do not care about YouTube’s profits). YouTube wants to present recommendations that lead you to develop habits that lead you to spend as much time on the platform as possible (YouTube does not care about your priorities). [^6]

I do not advocate that people stop using YouTube. The platform contains too much potential value at such a low immediate cost. However, it is important to understand the terms of use, and accept that YouTube is fundamentally adversarial to your accomplisment of goals and aspirations. Additionally, the YouTube recommendations algorithm is only ever going to get better. Alphabet is currently a world leader in building algorithms that beat people at games, and they are getting exponentially better.
